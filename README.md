# Match Game

An experimental game I'm building in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript while learning front end web development. Right now I'm building out the UI before moving on to the programming logic.

This match game well have themes to choose from with levels that become increasingly short in game duration. The first match game I'm working on is to match the logos of several technologies I'm learning or find interesting.

If you were to build such a game, what would your favorite theme be?
