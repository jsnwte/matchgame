# Match Game

An experimental game I'm building in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript while learning front end web development. A playable version (1.0) is now available! [Play it now](https://jsnwte.github.io/matchgame).

This match game has different themes to choose from with 10 levels that become increasingly short in game duration. For 2.0 I'm working on adding additional themes such as the logos of several technologies I'm learning or find interesting.

If you were to build such a game, what would your favorite theme be?

Check back to see updates as they are published.
