# Match Game

An experimental game I'm building in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript while learning front end web development. The main UI is complete, am now working on the programming logic.

This match game well have different themes to choose from with 10 levels that become increasingly short in game duration. The first match game I'm working on is basic alphanumeric chars. Once the game mechnics are complete I plan to add a theme to match the logos of several technologies I'm learning or find interesting.

If you were to build such a game, what would your favorite theme be?
